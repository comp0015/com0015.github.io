**COMP0015: Introduction to Programming** is a course at UCL, department of computer science. Students have been suffered from the poor teaching quality and irresponsible actions by the lecturer -- Dr Rae Harbird.

---
Here are some examples of how she responded to students' emails:

1. Consistently changing coursework questions/ requirements e.g. PS2 changed requirement until 1 week before deadline 
> “Consistently” could be denied. Better to state precisely which assignments were subject to major changes of requirements and then, for PS2, state when it was set, what was the deadline and on what dates were the requirements changed

2. Poor and unclear marking scheme (vague and harsh) 
> “harsh” is subjective, I suggest you remove this: you can legitimately criticise the scheme for being vague, but give one or two examples to illustrate what you mean

3. Losing marks from not doing extra stuff e.g. Was told to be unnecessary to add extra things 
> This can be wrapped into point 6 below, I think – it seems like basically the same as the “will our mark be deducted” issue. Again though: give an example

4. Randomly cancel office hour and not go to the workshop, i.e. only the assistant was present 
> Give dates on which office hours were cancelled. How much notice of the cancellation were you given?

5. The two ICAs, the Mid-term and End of Term Exams, include MCQs and open questions, i.e. a hand-written program code on paper was expected, despite posting at the beginning of term sample exams which didn’t include any open questions but only MCQs.

6. Insufficient comment from lecturer and got marked down for code that were told to be fine/perfect before submitted e.g. asked if a special command is not used, will our mark be deducted? She said no but she explicitly mentioned in the code for improvement purpose in the comments from coursework 
>I don’t know what “Insufficient comment from lecturer” means – do you mean that the feedback doesn’t help to justify the marks that were awarded? Also: it is entirely possible that you were not marked down for omitting a particular command even though it would have been better to use it – are you absolutely 100% sure that you were penalised for not using it, therefore? Feedback can sometimes say “this was really good so you’ve got a high mark, but nonetheless there’s still some room for improvement” – because there is ALWAYS still some room for improvement!

7. Were told “logical” code is fine and as a result many people just recite the codes without comprehending the true meaning of them 
> I don’t understand what you’re saying here: in any case, it sounds like a complaint that other students got good marks even though they didn’t understand the work. If this is what you’re saying, I think it’s hard to demonstrate that it is factually true: this point should be omitted therefore, you’ve got plenty of others!

8. Average mark 50-60, hardly see anyone above 70 (for coursework), i.e. too high standard/requirement for an introduction course 
>The “introductory” element of the course is irrelevant: the mark distribution should reflect achievement in relation to the learning outcomes for the course, regardless of what level it is. If there are hardly any “A” grades though, this would be a bit surprising. One question is: how do you know what the average mark is and how many “A” grades there were? If you know it because the lecturer told you, fine: if you only know it from talking to other stats students, then you can’t be 100% confident that the results are representative of the entire class.

9. Never Replies to email, i.e. An email sent in December regarding feedback on PS1 and the lecturer still hasn’t replied by now 
> Although the example here is clear, it’s a bit strong to claim that she “never” replies to email. If she replied to one email then this claim would be a lie! We must be professional … how widespread is the problem? You could, e.g., write (if true) “Several students have complained that they emailed the lecturer and did not receive a response e.g. an email sent in December …”

10. Delayed coursework release date by 2 weeks for PS2 and 3 weeks for ICA score is still not released. (meant to be 14th January) 
> I don’t understand this. Are you writing about two separate things? What do you mean by “coursework release date” – is this the date the coursework was handed out or the date that you should have received the results? Please write coherent sentences!

11. Long weekly coursework (need to spend 1 day per week) 
> This needs to be more specific. How many students have raised this concern, and what do you mean by “1 day”? Formally that’s 24 hours! So: of the students who have raised the concern, roughly how many hours per week are they spending?

12. Insufficient support, i.e. assistant being absent from the help desk and the assistant is unsure about how to tackle the question in assessments 
> Again, can you be specific? When is the assistant supposed to be present at the help desk? How many occasions have they not been present? How many occasions HAVE they been present?! You could also perhaps roll this into point 4 above: after all, if the office hour gets cancelled and the lecturer doesn’t turn up to the workshop then this is also “insufficient support”!
